# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part to tic-tac-toe was, although I thought it looked super easy, was actually the hsa_won part, because I think it was the python way that seemed a bit confusing at first.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I would add a computer player to the game as another player, maybe giving the human player the choice of "X" or "O" and making the computer player the other option. Then I would figure out different functions to make the computer player look for the best move.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I think it would be the most long-winded option, but I would make the computer check every spot on the board, and at the very least just make the computer super annoying where it's only moves are to block the human player from being able to win, which may (by complete chance) end in the computer winning the game somehow. I would do this by checking where the human player has placed their X's/O's, and based on that, using if/else statements with each assumed move of the human player to see where to place the computer's X/O.
